- Content: Write all the study guides
- Information architecture: how will I categorize the content so it's organized in a familiar
     and helpful way?
- Design the layout & how the user will flow from section to section or page to page.
- Place the content with HTML. 
    * Pages: 1 Home, many content pages, 1 About Morgan page
    * Main menu - on every page; has logo and "about Morgan" button
    * wiki menu - on every page; has broad topic titles like Scala and Git/GitHub and links to the specific pages within topics
    * table of contents - page-specific menus; links to the H2 headings and the references section on the page
    * Logo - links to home page
    * Buttons - 1 About Morgan in the main menu
    * Links - Inside each menu; social media links on the About Morgan page
    * Images - Logo; screenshots from my references and/or that I create myself 
        (I'm worried about violating licenses, so I want to make sure I'm using images properly or creating original ones. This is a learning opportunity.)
    
- Style the site with CSS. Use visual design principles to create the brand look 
    (remember, branding is the patterns you create with design elements. keep it simple!)
- Do whatever JavaScript does.
- publish the blog.
