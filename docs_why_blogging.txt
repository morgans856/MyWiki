I want control over how I format my posts. When I share what I learn in public, 
I want to format it in a way that's visually easy to read and pleasing to look at. 

I want to do a mix of content types: text, documents, links, images, and maybe even videos. 

I want a place for myself to come back to where I have all of my documentation in one place. 
It gets tricky to organize a lot of information. 
Plus, I can keep archives of information that's out of date when I make changes or updates. 
I FINALLY know that content creation is about documenting what you're already doing.
I want to feel my fear and do this anyway!
I want to keep learning web development.

Reflect on Morgan's documentation vs/as blog. Look at the structure I already have. 
What do I see? The idea of learning in public has me thinking about short-form 
content creation - am I ok with this?

Beginner's Guide to Data Engineering
- long-term project, no deadline. even if I work on this for 10 minutes a day,
     every day for 10 years, it will still be helpful because Engineering will just then be 
     mainstream lol.
- Keep it a practical resource, versus my feelings about my experience. 
    But, do remember what it felt like to be a beginner and how helpful it would have been 
    to have a full context of what data engineering is when I started.
- Done and thorough is better than perfect. Even if I need to go back and clarify or 
    flesh something out later, it's better to have a helpful resource in existence than not. 
    So, when it's done, it's done.


Study guides from the Revature curriculum
- created from many sources, not just Maria's lectures
Study guides from what I've studied during and since staging
- created, again from many sources

Take time to ask every question about each topic that I can think of. 
Create study sheets for everything. 

Organize the study sheets into a wiki with links to my references. 

Add an additional list of all online courses and YouTube videos and playlists that 
helped me with hands-on learning (Mosh, Data Structures & Algorithms on YouTube)
